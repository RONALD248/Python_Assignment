#  Basic Calculator Program

This is a simple command-line calculator written in Python. It allows a user to perform basic mathematical operations â€” addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division â€” on two numbers.

## Features

- Accepts two numbers from the user.
- Performs one of the following operations based on user input:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Handles division by zero gracefully.
- Outputs the result in a readable format.

##  How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer (version 3.x recommended).
2. Clone this repository or copy the code into a file named `calculator.py`.
3. Open a terminal and run the program:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py

   Follow the prompts:

Enter the first number.

Enter the second number.

Choose the operation (+, -, *, /).

 Example

Enter the first number: 10

Enter the second number: 5

Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +

10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
